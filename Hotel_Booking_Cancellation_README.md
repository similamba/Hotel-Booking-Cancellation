# Hotel Booking Cancellation Association Rule Mining

This project is focused on analyzing hotel booking data using association rule mining to identify patterns and rules related to hotel booking cancellation.






## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to analyze hotel booking data and identify factors that influence hotel booking cancellations. Association rule mining is a popular data mining technique used to identify patterns and relationships between different variables in a dataset.

In this project, we will be using association rule mining to identify relationships between various factors such as booking date, room type, duration of stay, etc., and the likelihood of a booking being cancelled. By identifying these relationships, we can gain insights into the factors that influence hotel booking cancellations and develop strategies to reduce cancellations.
## Data
The dataset used for this project is the Hotel Booking Demand dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, including booking date, room type, meal plan, duration of stay, and whether the booking was cancelled or not.

The dataset can be downloaded from the following link:

## Methodology
The methodology used in this project involves the following steps:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The raw data will be cleaned and preprocessed to remove any inconsistencies or missing values.

Association Rule Mining: The preprocessed data will be used to generate association rules using the Apriori algorithm. We will be using the Python library, mlxtend, to perform association rule mining.

Rule Evaluation and Visualization: The generated rules will be evaluated based on metrics such as support, confidence, and lift. We will also visualize the rules using various charts and graphs to gain insights into the relationships between different variables.
## Results
The results of this project will include a set of association rules that identify relationships between various factors and the likelihood of hotel booking cancellations. We will also provide insights and recommendations based on the generated rules to help hotel managers reduce the number of cancellations and improve their revenue.
